### Hi

This is **Nirmal Kumar R**. I go by the handle of _mysticmode_, _tildezero_ or just my name over the web.

I started my professional career in IT by 2012 when I was around 20 years old dropping out of college
for multiple reasons that is a total waste in expressing it here. I started with Front-end development,
UI design and a quick Wireframe Prototyper with pencil and paper for clients to show what's going on in
my mind at that spot. The tech-stack I had knowledge at this time was HTML5, CSS3, Javascript mostly
with jQuery and Python.

For the last 7 years, I started doing full-time positions as a backend developer mostly writing code in Go.

At this juncture, I stopped doing professional jobs for sometime, I wanted to see Computers and Programming
not only being an useful utility but also to be a fun utility to do something that I'm interested in, doesn't
matter if the crowd likes it or not.

So, now - I'm quite interested in knowing the Fundamentals of Computer Science and I'm learning C and Assembly
coding. Adding some spicy to it, mathematics which had been a mystery to me my whole life thus far. But I'm
taking baby-steps here to learn linear algebra and calculus.
